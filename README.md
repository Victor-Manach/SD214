# SD214
Lab sessions for the SD214: Machine learning for text mining course at Télécom Paris. The goal of the labs was to learn how to use the different machine learning models we had seen in class and interpret the results thanks to the theoretical concepts we had seen:
* Lab 1: Sentiment analysis with Naive Bayes and word embeddings (use of word2vec and Gl0ve embeddings)
* Lab: 2: Hidden Markov Models for text segmentation (segmentation of e-mails, implementation of the Viterbi and the forward-backward algorithms)
* Lab 3: Recurrent Neural Network to perform automatic rating of movies given the texts of the reviews
